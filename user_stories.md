Bus-Mall User Stories

As a Dev:

Ensure I can track the clicks for each img
Ensure each image being displayed is unique
I will create a constructor that creates an object associated w/ ea img that has the path, number of times it's been shown and licked
Ensure that after 25 clicks stopEventListener

As the Marketing Research Team

Ensure the end user sees their correct scrore at the end of the exercise
Ensure the user only sees their scrore after 25 selections
Ensure the end result gives me a percentage of pictures clicked compared to their frequency

As the Focus Group

Are the pictures easy to see and click?
How many clicks do I have left?
What were my results?
